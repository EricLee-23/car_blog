        <h2>THE CH.DETALING PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <p>
          Automotive detailing is the art of creating a refined aesthetic, and
          it requires copious amounts of time, passion, and determination.
          Proper detailing and paint correction works to preserve your
          automotive investment and can even recondition neglected vehicles to a
          level that will rival much more costly and invasive restorations.
          Utilizing only the best products and the safest methods combined with
          an experienced and knowledgeable detailer will ensure that the work is
          done right, the first time. A thorough understanding of vehicle
          surfaces, the issues that affect them, and the appropriate methods to
          correct each issue is the key to effective detailing with long term
          results. Simply put, all the services I offer work to maintain a
          vehicle’s integrity and value, while simultaneously elevating the
          aesthetics to jaw-dropping levels that won't fade away after the first
          wash.
        </p>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 20px;">"PERFECTION IS CREATED WITH DETAIL."</h3>
        <p>
          The transformation that every car receives is only half the battle.
          Without proper attention and maintenance the look of a freshly
          detailed finish will inevitably fade, this is why I make every effort
          to educate my clients on how to properly care for their vehicles. The
          development of a skilled eye with an appreciation and understanding
          for the detailing process will make sure that your vehicle looks great
          long after a CH.Detailed finish has been achieved.
        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top: 20px;">ABOUT CH.DETAILING</h1>
        <p>
          CH.Detailing was created in 2009 by Connor Harrison and is operated
          out of Madison, WI. He has had experience detailing just about
          everything on wheels, from daily driven sub-compacts, to trailered
          track day toys, to high end exotics, and everything in between. Connor
          began his life as a detailer in 2007 when he began working at a local
          dealership, it was this part-time job during high school that sparked
          a deep interest in transforming vehicle aesthetics. He learned a lot
          while working at the dealership, the principal fact of which was that
          most dealerships are entirely unqualified to detail anything, and will
          often do more harm than good. His need to produce a higher quality of
          work than what was imposed on him at the dealership is what initially
          drove him to create CH.Detailing.

        <p>
          Motivated by a love for all things automotive, Connor strives to
          enhance the cosmetics of every vehicle he works on while also
          protecting them for the future. Obsessed with polishing paint, he
          thoroughly enjoys the process of bringing a deep reflective shine to
          every vehicle he touches. It is Connor’s passion and obsession that
          leads him to be emotionally invested in his work, and it is this
          investment that truly makes the CH.Detailed vehicle stand out above
          the rest. The experience he has gleaned from working on all forms of
          classic, vintage, and modern automobiles is an invaluable asset to you
          and your cherished automobile.
